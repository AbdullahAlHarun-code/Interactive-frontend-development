## Strategy
If you know what you are doing, you can't lose at Tic-Tac-Toe. If your opponent knows what they are doing, you can't win at Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is a zero sum game. If both players are playing with an optimal strategy, every game will end in a tie.

####  Players
There are four player types in Tic-Tac-Toe.
* The Novice player makes random moves
* The Intermediate player will blocks their opponent from winning
* The Experienced player knows that playing in certain first squares will lose the game
* The Expert player will never lose

## Scope
This is a single-player or tow player strategy game on the web browser. The player will
progress through levels which require precise manipulation of the environment, though the game
Encourages creativity and daring via branching pathways. The episodic structure of the game
facilitates the pace of the story. I demonstrate the action flow between inputs, script, display
(output).


## Structure
